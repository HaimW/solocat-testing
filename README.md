# 🎵 Audio Processing System - Testing Framework

A comprehensive mock-based testing framework for distributed audio processing systems.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <repository>
cd solocat-testing
make setup && make test

# Run tests
./scripts/run_tests.sh demo    # Basic validation
make test-all                  # Full test suite
```

## 📊 Current Status

**Tests**: 84 total | **Recent Improvements**: Fixed mock integration and reduced failures from 51 to ~30

| Category | Tests | Status | Notes |
|----------|-------|--------|-------|
| Unit | 28 | ✅ Most passing | Algorithm & component tests |
| Functional | 14 | 🟡 Improving | End-to-end integration |
| Performance | 20 | ✅ Passing | Load & stress tests |
| Security | 22 | 🟡 Most passing | Vulnerability tests |
