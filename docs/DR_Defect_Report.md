### 2.1 Critical Defects (Severity 1)

#### Defect ID: DEF-005
**Summary:** Data consistency failure during concurrent database writes  
**Component:** Database Layer  
**Severity:** Critical  
**Priority:** P1  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed  
**Found Date:** 2024-01-14  
**Fixed Date:** 2024-01-20  

**Description:**
During concurrent write operations to the features table, data consistency checks failed resulting in potential data corruption. The issue occurred when multiple Algorithm B instances attempted to write Feature Type B records simultaneously.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Start 5 Algorithm B instances
2. Send 100 concurrent Feature Type A messages
3. Monitor database for data consistency
4. Verify feature records integrity

**Expected Result:**
All feature records should be written correctly with proper data integrity maintained.

**Actual Result:**
3 out of 100 records showed data inconsistency with overlapping feature_id values.

**Root Cause:**
Database transaction isolation level was set to READ_COMMITTED instead of SERIALIZABLE, allowing race conditions during concurrent writes.

**Resolution:**
- Updated database configuration to use SERIALIZABLE isolation level
- Implemented proper transaction handling with retry logic
- Added database constraint checks for feature_id uniqueness

**Test Evidence:**
- Log files: `/logs/database/consistency_failure_20240114.log`
- Screenshots: Available in defect tracking system
- Code changes: Commit #a1b2c3d4

#### Defect ID: DEF-012
**Summary:** Memory leak in Algorithm A during continuous processing  
**Component:** Algorithm A  
**Severity:** Critical  
**Priority:** P1  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed  
**Found Date:** 2024-02-08  
**Fixed Date:** 2024-02-12  

**Description:**
Algorithm A exhibits significant memory growth during extended processing sessions, leading to pod crashes after approximately 6 hours of continuous operation.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Start Algorithm A pod
2. Send continuous audio processing requests (100 msg/hour)
3. Monitor memory usage over 8 hours
4. Observe memory growth pattern

**Expected Result:**
Memory usage should remain stable around 512MB baseline.

**Actual Result:**
Memory usage grows linearly to 4GB+ causing pod termination.

**Root Cause:**
Audio buffers and feature extraction objects were not being properly garbage collected due to circular references in the audio processing pipeline.

**Resolution:**
- Implemented explicit cleanup of audio buffers after processing
- Fixed circular references in feature extraction classes
- Added memory monitoring and automatic garbage collection triggers

**Performance Impact:**
- Before fix: Memory growth 50MB/hour
- After fix: Stable memory usage ±20MB

**Test Evidence:**

**Priority:** P1  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed  
**Found Date:** 2024-02-28  
**Fixed Date:** 2024-03-05  

**Description:**
During high load testing (>800 msg/sec), the RabbitMQ connection pool becomes exhausted causing message processing failures and system instability.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Configure load test with 1000 msg/sec
2. Run test for 30 minutes
3. Monitor RabbitMQ connection pool
4. Observe connection exhaustion

**Expected Result:**
System should handle 1000 msg/sec sustained load without connection issues.

**Actual Result:**
Connection pool exhausted after 15 minutes, causing 25% message failure rate.

**Root Cause:**
Connection pool size was hardcoded to 50 connections and connections were not being properly released after use.

**Resolution:**
- Implemented dynamic connection pool sizing based on load
- Added proper connection lifecycle management
- Implemented connection health checks and auto-recovery

**Configuration Changes:**
```yaml
rabbitmq:
  connection_pool:
    initial_size: 10
    max_size: 200
    auto_scale: true
    health_check_interval: 30s
```
